<p>
This paper suggests that waste policy can reduce the incidence of low birth weights in low income populations to a similar extent as SNAP and EITC. A very simple economic model of recycling participation implies that recycling for cash transfers wealth to low-wage earners. Between 1973 and 1990, ten states introduced deposit refund programs for beverage containers. These deposit refund policies likely increased the magnitude of wealth transfers associated with recycling. This paper exploits idiosyncratic variation in the timing and location of policy implementation to measure for any reduction in the incidence of low birth weights associated with deposit refund programs. The results show deposit refund policy introductions are associated with a .3 percentage point reduction in the incidence of low birth weight on average among mothers with less than a high school education. I rely on the literature connecting wealth transfers and birth outcomes to argue this result extends a small empirical literature highlighting the progressive nature of beverage container deposit refund programs.
