This paper tests whether laws that encourage beverage container recycling through a deposit refund scheme improve birth outcomes in low income populations. A very simple economic model of recycling participation and labor supply suggests that recycling activity transfers wealth to low-wage earners. Between 1973 and 1990, ten states introduced deposit refund programs for beverage containers. This paper exploits idiosyncratic variation in the timing and location of policy implementation to measure and test for any reduction in the incidence of low birth weights associated with deposit refund programs. The results show deposit refund policy introductions are associated with a .3 percentage point reduction in the incidence of low birth weight on average among mothers with less than a high school education. I rely on the literature connecting wealth transfers and birth outcomes to argue this result extends a small empirical literature highlighting the progressive nature of beverage container deposit refund programs.
